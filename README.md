The potential customers have more interests in boats with the length under 40 and the width under 10 compared to the larger boats. Over 9888 boats, GRP has been used a lot to build boats. Boat manufacturer A can consider to use 'GRP' to build a new boat. Also, based on the numbers of views in the last 7 days, boats made of plastic have more search. Therefore, the manufacturer A can consider to use either GRP or plastic to build their new boat.
